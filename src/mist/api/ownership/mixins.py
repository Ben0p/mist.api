    """A mixin class that adds reference to the owner/creator of a resource

    The creator of a resource is set once the resource is created and stays
    the same throughout the resource's lifetime. Initially, the owner of a
    resource is the same as its creator. However, transfer of ownership is
    possible.

    The idea of ownership may also be used to extend RBAC. The owner of a
    resource may be granted full access rights on it. For this functionality
    to be enabled, set Organization.ownership_enabled to True.

    This mixin can be used with any mist.io resource, which is a subclass of
    me.Document.

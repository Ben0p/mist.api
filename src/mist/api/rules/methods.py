    """Run a Rule's actions.

    Runs actions based on the rule's state. This method will initially check
    whether a NoData alert has been raised in order to call a special NoData
    action. In case a rule is re-triggered or its state transitions from the
    untriggered to triggered state and vice versa, relevant events will also
    be logged.

    When a monitoring rule is triggered, this method will asynchronously apply
    a celery chain of the rule's actions that have been specified by user. The
    chain's tasks are executed sequentially, meaning that the next task in the
    chain is executed once the one that preceded it has completed successfully.

    It is IMPORTANT to create a chain of immutable tasks (using the `.si`
    callable, instead of the more regularly used `.s`), since by default a
    chained task provides its output as the following task's input, which may
    yield unexpected behavior.

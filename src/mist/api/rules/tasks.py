    it. If a task fails and raises an exception, the chain will transition
    to the failure state and the rest of the chain's tasks will not run.

    This task will be retried in case it's failed up to `self.max_retries`
    times with an interval based on `self.default_retry_delay`. Note that
    celery will not move on to the next task in the chain, while a task is

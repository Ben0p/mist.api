class ElasticQueryHandler(object):
    """Basic handler for querying Elasticsearch.

    This query handler can be used to request documents from an Elasticsearch
    node/cluster. Every instance of the `ElasticQueryHandler` is bound to an
    Organization, so that all queries are performed within the context of the
    given `owner_id`. Also, each instance of the handler can be further bound
    to a single resource provided its resource type (ex. machine, script, key,
    etc.) and UUID.

    The base query is returned by the `_get_query` method. It may be overriden
    by subclasses in order to extend the query with extra clauses, like `sort`
    or `size`, as well as aggregations. It is recommended that a new subclass
    of the `ElasticQueryHandler` is implemented for a new aggregation query so
    that each - potentially heavy - aggregation is performed in a controlled
    environment by a specific query handler.

    The `ElasticQueryHandler` enables both queries on exact matches with the
    use of a low-level Term Query, as well full-text search by leveraging a
    Query String Query (recommended). A Query String Query understands how the
    fields of an index have been analyzed and can be used for full-text search,
    as well as exact match requests.

    Note that search requests are limited to application logs only.
